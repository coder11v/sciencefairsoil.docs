### 🎯 The Mission
> "Agriculture uses 70% of world freshwater... The world is in a race to grow more food with less water."

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
My project aims to prove that affordable moisture sensors can provide **professional-grade accuracy** to optimize water consumption. By switching to smart irrigation, we can:
*   **Save Water**: Target 20% reduction.
*   **Grow Better**: Higher yields through consistent moisture.
