Growing **Super Sugar Snap Peas** (*Pisum sativum var. Macrocarpon*) indoors in pots requires more frequent but smaller volumes of water compared to outdoor garden beds. Indoors, air is typically drier, and pots have limited soil volume to hold moisture.

For a standard **12-inch (5-gallon) pot** containing 2–3 Super Sugar Snap plants, you should aim for approximately **1,500 mL to 2,000 mL per week**.

### Weekly Watering Breakdown (Indoor Pots)

Since you are indoors, do not pour the entire weekly amount at once. Indoor pots lack the natural drainage of the earth and are prone to root rot if they sit in "standing" water.

* **Standard Schedule:** **~500 mL** every 2–3 days.
* **During Flowering/Podding:** Increase to **~750 mL** every 2 days. This variety is "heavy-bearing" and will drop its flowers if the soil dries out even once.

### Critical Indoor Care Factors

Because Super Sugar Snaps are vining plants that can reach 5–6 feet, their "thirst" changes rapidly as they grow.

| Phase | Estimated mL/Week | Focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Seedling (0-4")** | **500 mL** | Keep the top inch of soil "wrung-out sponge" damp. |
| **Climbing (Vines)** | **1,500 mL** | Consistent moisture to support the rapidly growing stem and tendrils. |
| **Harvest (Pods)** | **2,000+ mL** | Maximum water needed to make the "Sugar Snap" pods juicy and sweet. |

### 3 Rules for Indoor Success

1. **The "Finger Test" is Law:** Before adding your mLs, stick your finger 1 inch into the soil. If it's damp, wait. If it's dry, water. Indoor evaporation varies wildly based on your home's heating/AC.
2. **Avoid the Leaves:** Indoor air circulation is lower than outdoors. Water only at the base of the plant to prevent **Powdery Mildew**, which looks like white flour on the leaves and can kill indoor peas quickly.
3. **Temperature Alert:** Super Sugar Snaps love the "cool" part of the house. Keep them away from radiators or heat vents; if the soil gets too warm ( or ), the plant will stop producing peas regardless of how much water you give it.

This is an excellent setup for a "Smart Irrigation" experiment. Comparing a **fixed timer** (Control) against an **automated threshold** (Variable) is the standard way to prove water efficiency in agricultural science.

However, your specific thresholds (**30% to 80%**) may be slightly risky for "Super Sugar Snap" peas, which are sensitive to both drought and "wet feet" (root rot).

### Analysis of Your Thresholds

* **The "Low" (30%):** This is on the edge of "danger zone" for peas. Most vegetables prefer to stay above **40% moisture**. At 30%, a pea plant’s shallow roots may already be experiencing "water stress," which can lead to flower drop.
* **The "High" (80%):** This is very high for a pot. 80% is near **Field Capacity** (where the soil is holding all the water it possibly can). In a pot with limited drainage, staying at 80% for too long can starve the roots of oxygen.

### Recommended "Smart" Settings

For a more successful experiment, I suggest narrowing the window slightly to keep the "Smart" group in its "Optimal Zone":

| Setting | Recommended % | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Lower Limit (Start)** | **45%** | Keeps the plant in the "comfort zone" so it never stops growing. |
| **Upper Limit (Stop)** | **70%** | Provides plenty of water without "drowning" the roots in the bottom of the pot. |

### How to Improve the Experiment

To make your data more "scientific," consider tracking these three metrics for both groups:

1. **Water Consumption:** Keep a log of exactly how many mLs the "Smart" group uses vs. the "Timer" group. (The goal of smart irrigation is usually to produce the same crop using **less** total water).
2. **Node Counting:** Count how many "nodes" (the spots where leaves come out) each plant has. Water-stressed plants will have shorter distances between nodes.
3. **The "Wilt Watch":** If your "Smart" group hits 30% and the leaves look slightly grey or droopy, your sensor might be buried too deep or too shallow.

> **Important Note on Sensor Placement:** > Peas have shallow roots. Ensure your sensor is buried about **3–4 inches deep**. If it's at the very bottom of the pot, it will read "wet" while the plant’s roots at the top are actually bone dry.
